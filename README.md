## Description
For so many of us, our downtime is limited and precious. We live in a world where this is possible, but there lies the problem in itself; possibilites! What a myriad of options available at our fingertips, movies for every mood. This application aims to take the scroll work out of your hands and present you with a movie choice that matches your current mental state. If you click an emoji that matches your mood, you should be presented with a movie in kind, also drink suggestions with a how-to as a bonus. Enjoy!!
